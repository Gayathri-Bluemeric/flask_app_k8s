# Kubernetes ClusterRole Troubleshooting & User Guide 

This guide is focused on understanding the ClusterRole resource in the context of Kubernetes, identifying any issues or potential improvements, and providing instructions for making adjustments. The document is based on comparison with OpenAPI schema definitions and Prometheus metrics (if available).

## Schema
Given the OpenAPI schema is empty, there isn't a baseline configuration to compare against. However, we can cross-check the list of properties found in the YAML input against the basic properties commonly observed in a ClusterRole. Typically, it should consists of properties such as `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `rules`, etc.

## YAML Analysis
The ClusterRole in the YAML input is defined as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: 'true'
  creationTimestamp: '2023-12-07T07:04:58Z'
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/bootstrapping: rbac-defaults
  name: cluster-admin
  resourceVersion: '71'
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - '*'
    resources:
      - '*'
    verbs:
      - '*'
  - nonResourceURLs:
      - '*'
    verbs:
      - '*'
```

In the content above, there is no clear discrepancy or issue. The clusterRole "cluster-admin" is given full permissions on all resources, apiGroups, and nonResourceURLs. While this might be needed for some cases, it could potentially lead to security risks. You might want to review your RBAC policies to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.

## Kubernetes Commands
To inspect the "cluster-admin" ClusterRole, execute the following command:

```sh
kubectl describe clusterrole cluster-admin
```

The response will provide more detail on the ClusterRole, including what permissions it has.

To modify the ClusterRole, you can edit it directly using:

```sh
kubectl edit clusterrole cluster-admin
```

However, be cautious while adjusting permissions as it may affect users or services associated with this ClusterRole. It's advised to properly understand the impact on dependent applications or team members before making such changes.

To create a new ClusterRole with less permissions, you can create a new yaml file with the desired rules and use the following command:

```sh
kubectl create -f <your-file-name>.yaml
```

Replace `<your-file-name>` with the name of your yaml file.

Remember, understanding the security implications associated with clusterRoles and RBAC is key to managing a secure Kubernetes environment. For this purpose, reviewing official Kubernetes RBAC documentation on a regular basis is strongly recommended.
